# ðŸ’° Currency Converter  

A Flutter project I built while learning Flutterâ€”because knowing how much your coffee costs in another country is surprisingly satisfying.  

## Features  
- Converts currency (because math is hard)  
- Clean UI (because chaos is for backend errors)  
- Quick and efficient (because time is money... literally)  

## Installation  
Clone the repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sumit7739/currency_converter.git
```

## Usage  
1. Open the app.  
2. Choose currencies.  
3. Be amazed (or mildly unimpressed).  

## Why?  
I needed a Flutter project.  
Because exchange rates matter.  
Because why not?
